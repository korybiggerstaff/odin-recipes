    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp black peppercorns, roughly cracked</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped scallions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, olive oil, brown sugar, and crushed peppercorns in a medium bowl until sugar is dissolved. Stir in bay leaves. </li>
        <li>Line the bottom of a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) with onion slices. Place chicken thighs over onion and pour vinegar mixture over the top. Close and lock the lid. </li>
        <li>Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build. </li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Release pressure using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Using tongs, transfer chicken thighs to the prepared baking sheet, skin-side up. Select Saut√© function and cook until sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to high. </li>
        <li>Cook chicken under the preheated broiler until skin is crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving plate and spoon sauce over the top. Garnish with scallions. </li>
    </ol>
